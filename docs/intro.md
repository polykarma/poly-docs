# Welcome to PolyDocs Documentation

## About This Documentation

PolyDocs is a collaborative effort to document and organize educational resources at Polytechnique Montreal. This documentation section is designed to be a resource hub for students, with course notes, tutorials, and guides across a variety of subjects.

## Contributing to the Documentation

We welcome contributions from everyone! Here are some specific guidelines to help you get started:

- **Organizing Content**: Place content in the appropriate folder based on type (e.g., tutorials, notes, or translations).
- **Review Process**: Contributions will be reviewed to ensure quality and consistency.



## Suggested Topics and Content Roadmap

Here are some areas where contributions are especially welcome:

- **New Course Notes**: We’re currently missing notes for most Poly courses!
- **Translations**: We need translations for several sections to make PolyDocs accessible to more students.
- **Tutorials and Guides**: If you have expertise in a topic, consider writing a tutorial to help others learn.

## Style Guide

To maintain consistency across our documentation, please follow these guidelines:

- **Use a friendly, clear tone**: Aim to make content easy to understand.
- **Be consistent with terminology**: Use consistent terminology, such as “assignment” instead of “homework.”
- **Include examples where possible**: Illustrations and examples help readers understand complex topics.
