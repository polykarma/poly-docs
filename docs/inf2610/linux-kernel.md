# Linux Kernel

The Linux kernel is a monolithic kernel, meaning that it runs in kernel mode and has full access to the hardware. It is written in C and assembly, and is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL). The kernel is responsible for managing the system's resources, such as the CPU, memory, and I/O devices.
